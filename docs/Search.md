Certainly! To rank the results based on the closeness of the match, you can use the `ts_rank` function to assign a rank to each result based on the `tsvector` match. We'll adjust the query to include ranking and sort the results accordingly.

Here's the full query with ranking:

```sql
-- Big Search with Ranking
SELECT
    identification_number,
    last_name,
    first_name,
    middle_name,
    status,
    house_number,
    street_name,
    zip,
    city,
    ts_rank(address_searchable, to_tsquery('english', '600:* | Walte:* | Ree:* | Driv:*')) AS rank
FROM
    electorate.voter_lookup
WHERE
    full_name_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', 'Bent:* | Fost:* | Hense:*')
    AND address_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', '600:* | Walte:* | Ree:* | Driv:*')
    AND city_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', 'Arling:*')
    AND zip_searchable @@ to_tsquery('simple', '2220:*')
ORDER BY
    rank DESC;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Ranking**:
   - `ts_rank(address_searchable, to_tsquery('english', '600:* | Walte:* | Ree:* | Driv:*')) AS rank` calculates the rank for each result based on the relevance of the address search terms.

2. **Ordering**:
   - `ORDER BY rank DESC` orders the results by the calculated rank in descending order, with the highest relevance at the top.

### Adjusted Explanation of the Query:
- **Name Search**:
  - `full_name_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', 'Bent:* | Fost:* | Hense:*')` matches names containing terms starting with "Bent", "Fost", or "Hense".
- **Address Search**:
  - `address_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', '600:* | Walte:* | Ree:* | Driv:*')` matches addresses containing terms starting with "600", "Walte", "Ree", or "Driv".
- **City Search**:
  - `city_searchable @@ to_tsquery('english', 'Arling:*')` matches cities containing terms starting with "Arling".
- **ZIP Code Search**:
  - `zip_searchable @@ to_tsquery('simple', '2220:*')` matches ZIP codes starting with "2220".

This query will now rank the results based on how closely they match the provided address search terms and display the most relevant results at the top.
